## Features
### 🎨 Realistic color mixing
Import your own photos, select any desired color directly from the image, and learn how to mix it with your paints.

Our web app provides a step-by-step guide on how to precisely mix that color using your own paints using atomic or optical mixing.

Atomic mixing is the physical mixing of colors together, while optical mixing is the result of placing a transparent layer of color over another color (glaze technique).

The color of a paint mixture is calculated as the weighted geometric mean of the paints' reflectance curves.
The reflectance curves of paints and mixes can be visualized.

### ✏️ Tonal values
Use tonal value sketches that capture the light and shadow of your subject to learn how to create contrast and depth in your paintings.
